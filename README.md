## Part 3 - Web Component

For this deliverable, I created Web Components to represent the question and progress bar present in a quiz. I used the color, typography, and button styling from Pearson's Style Guide, but put my own interpretation on how to layout the quiz questions rather than using the radio buttons Web Component.

I was unable to figure out how to asynchronously import the question content from different JSON files, so any feedback on how to improve that aspect would be really helpful! Thank you!
